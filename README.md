# AppSpaces
Desktop spaces for your apps

## WiP
This is once again just a PoC based on an idea that popped in my head. Whether I will finish this or not is to be seen...

## Definitions
- A space is an area on the screen.
- An AppSpace in an application linked to an app and all its windows.
- An AppSpace cannot contain any duplicate apps, 1 app can be placed in 1 space only.
- You can define multiple AppSpaces

## Use cases
- When a new window is opened it should be placed in its designated space
- When a window is dropped in a space it is maximized within that space.
    - A question is asked whether the app should be linked to that space.
        - If if was already linked to another space it is moved.
- When an app is maximized it is maximized within the space the click was in. Optionally?
